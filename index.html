            <span class="text-6xl block mb-8">Hi, my name is Joakim</span>
            <span class="text-4xl block mb-48">...and I am a creative, and soon-to-be Frontend developer. I have years of experience working with UX/UI and digital design. As a developer, my goal is to create solutions that brings something new to the table (or screen in this case).</span>

                <span class="block text-4xl mb-4">Code</span>
                <p class="text-2xl">Specialize in coding UIs and functionality that appeals and helps the user to solve their tasks. As a new developer, I want to expand the knowledge needed to build solutions for the future. Currently, I focus on JavaScript, TypeScript and the React framework. But with time I look forward to digging deeper into alternative JavaScript frameworks (looking at you Vue).</p>

                <span class="block text-4xl mb-4">Design</span>
                <p class="text-2xl">The role as a Frontend developer appealed to me as you have your hands in both jars (think this is a Swedish expression). Or, working closely with team members who have thier hand in the design jar. In my previous roles, I have worked with creating various types of UIs and designs for different types of content. I have no problem working with tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Figma and Blender (for 3D visualization).</p>
